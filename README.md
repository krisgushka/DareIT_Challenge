# Task 1 Software configuration
## Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?

I joined DareIT course because I want to start career in QA Testing and highly interested in finding job in Poland.
I am looking for my place in IT for a long time now and try to learn different things to see what works best for me.
I expect first of all to improve *soft skills* and feel more comfortable in a *team work*.
